## Description of this project
This is a basic project with React Native and a back-end in Node.js to test the notification system that can be made with a library called [react-native-push-notification]{https://github.com/zo0r/react-native-push-notification}.

To make the system check every 15 minutes, it also uses a library called [react-native-background-task]{https://github.com/jamesisaac/react-native-background-task}.
